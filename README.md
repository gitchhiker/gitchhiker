ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gitchhiker

I know some C++ and Python that I would like to deepen, preferably in a collaborative project.

My scientific interest ranges from fundamental physics to complex systems, and more specifically environmental physics, and network science.

I like git, I like hiking, hitchhiking, towels, and Vogon poetry. ðŸ™‚

For project suggestions, give me a shout to gitchhiker@posteo.org

Paul
